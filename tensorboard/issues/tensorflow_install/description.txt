Problem:
When trying to install TensorFlow on the Docker image errors occur. There is a message when running Tensorboard without Tensorflow that it is not operating at full capacity.

 - Minimal install (Python/PIP and running a pip install -r requirements.txt w/ tensorflow as a dependency OR installing Tensorflow via PIP) we get
      copying h5py/tests/data_files/vlen_string_dset_utc.h5 -> build/lib.linux-aarch64-cpython-312/h5py/tests/data_files
      running build_ext
      Building h5py requires pkg-config unless the HDF5 path is explicitly specified using the environment variable HDF5_DIR. For more information and details, see https://docs.h5py.org/en/stable/build.html#custom-installation
      error: pkg-config probably not installed: FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory')

 - The above error also occurs when we manually install hpf5 with w/get and build, then set the HPF5_DIR to /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/hdf5


 - If we let the apt-get statement do all the work with the *-dev installs plus other stuff then set HPF5_DIR to /hdf5-1.14.4-3/hdf5 we get:

    28.72   note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip.

    28.84 ERROR: ERROR: Failed to build installable wheels for some pyproject.toml based projects (h5py)


I'm tired of pouring time into this, going with a non-Tensorflow install for now.
